## CUTE Bench Suit
This repository can generate CUTE test ELF files, and the benchmarks are resnet50 and vgg19. 

CUTE and BOOM are connected, and configuration and query instructions are sent to CUTE by the CPU.

If you want to execute the program on the BOOM+CUTE simulator generated by verilator, first use the RISC-V cross-compiler to compile any .c file in this repository. The script file `compile.sh` is an example of compiling these test programs. Just replace .c with the file you want to compile.
